<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The aim of the project was to build a hybrid k-means and hierarchical clustering-based customer segmentation system targeted to online retailers, that can be used for building targeted promotions. 

#### Why this approche was chosen 
K-means has better performance and is faster for larger data sets. It is also the most popular
and most used for segmentation. Hierarchal approach provides better results for higher k values
and the results of the hierarchal clustering is easier to analyse. Hence, the data pre-processing
methods and choice of clusters is just as important as the algorithm chosen. In conclusion, a
combination of both, meaning a hybrid approach of hierarchal and k-means can be used to
produce the best result. 

####  Result
This model was able to predict customer segments with an accuracy of 86.8% 
Hierarchical clustering handles smaller datasets really well but with large datasets, computation time is higher that k-means. The adjusted random score gives the value of similarity. This adjusted random score between K hierarchical clustering is approximately 96%.
